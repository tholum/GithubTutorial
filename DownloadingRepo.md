# Downloading a repo
Once you have a repo to work with, or if you are going to join an exiting project, You will need to clone your repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tholum/GithubTutorial.git
```

There are 2 methods that github allows, ssh and https. 

### Advantages of ssh 
* Allows ssh keys for auth ( You do not have to type in your username and password every push )
* Allows you to have read only, repo specific keys ( Great for pushing your apps to servers, that you do not want to commit back )

### Advantages of https
* Does not require you to have keys set up and tied to your account
